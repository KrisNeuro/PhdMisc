Miscellaneous scripts I wrote for my research project or to help other students during later grad school years (~8/2017 to 8/2019) when I was learning to code. 

No promises of stability or flexibility for other users than for whom these were written.  
Some files are visibly incomplete; they are archived here in case of future need.
